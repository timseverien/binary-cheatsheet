		Looking at your computer screen, what do you see? Text, colours, images, videos and much more.
		Everything you see, everything you store on your computer, every button you press is a stream of
		ones and zeros. Why? How does it work?
	</p>

	<p>
		Computers parts are able to store data via tiny electronic components called <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(electronics)">flip-flops</a
		>. They can be set to either of two states: “one” or “zero.” These components can store a single
		value we call a bit.
	</p>

	<p>
		To store other values than ones and zeroes, a series of bits can be grouped. If one bit can have
		two different states, a group of two bits can have four. A group of four bits can have up to
		sixteen unique states. The amount of different states grows exponentially for every bit that is
		added to a group. <code>s = n<sup>2</sup></code>, where s is the number of states, and n the
		number of bits within the group.
	</p>

	<p>
		The de-facto standard is to call a group of bits a byte, and one byte contains 8 bits. The more
		explicit term for an 8-bit group is octet.
	</p>

	<p>
		Binary is the purest representation of data on computers, but it isn’t easy to understand what
		the data represents. How do we get from binary to other values?
	</p>

	<h3 id="representation">Representation</h3>

	<p>
		Many typed programming languages have datatypes like integers, floats, strings, etc. These
		datatypes tell the computer how to interpret binary data. Instead of modifying bits and bytes to
		add two integers, we can use arithmetic operators, like a plus (+), and the computer will know
		what to do at binary level. Dynamically typed languages do the same, but also removes the need
		to tell which variable has which type.
	</p>

	<p>
		A common datatype is an unsigned integer (uint). When an integer is signed, the first bit will
		be used to store whether the integer is a positive or negative integer. When it’s unsigned, the
		data type can only store positive integers. So a uint is an integer that must be equal or
		greater than 0.
	</p>

	<p>
		Let’s have look at the binary representation of such an integer, in 8 bits. A uint is a positive
		integer starting from 0. Incrementing is very similar to our decimal system:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Increment the least significant number</li>
		<li>
			If least significant number exceeds maximum value, reset and increment the number one place
			left
		</li>
	</ol>
